### Status codes explanation

**200 OK**

All the events are sent successfully.

```
[
    {
     "id": "9cdd0f68-df85-44b0-88bd-fc4163ac90a0",
     "status_code": 200,
     "result": "SUCCESS",
     "message": "Event sent successfully"
    },
    {
     "id": "9cdd0f68-df85-44b0-88bd-fc4163ac90a1",
     "status_code": 200,
     "result": "SUCCESS",
     "message": "Event sent successfully"
    }
]
```

**207 Multi-Status**

Events are having different internal status codes.

```
[
    {
     "id": "9cdd0f68-df85-44b0-88bd-fc4163ac90a0",
     "status_code": 200,
     "result": "SUCCESS",
     "message": "Event sent successfully"
    },
    {
     "status_code": 400,
     "result": "Bad Request",
     "message": "Invalid event content, client need to fix problem in event before submitting again"
    }
]
```

**400 Bad Request**

The input JSON is malformed.

```
[
    {
     "status_code": 400,
     "result": "Bad Request",
     "message": "Invalid event content, client need to fix problem in event before submitting again"
    }
]
```

**404 Not Found**

RabbitMQ properties not configured in tomcat/conf/config.properties file for the protocol.

```
[
    {
     "status_code": 404,
     "result": "RabbitMQ properties not found",
     "message": "RabbitMQ properties not configured for the protocol <protocol>"
    }
]
```

**500 Internal Server Error**

Cannot prepare routing key.

```
[
    {
     "status_code": 500,
     "result": "Internal Server Error",
     "message": "Could not prepare Routing key to publish message"
    }
]
```

Event is failed to send because of internal server error.

```
[
    {
     "id": "9cdd0f68-df85-44b0-88bd-fc4163ac90a0",
     "status_code": 500,
     "result": "Internal Server Error",
     "message": "RabbitMQ is down. Please try later"
    }
]
```

**503 Service Unavailable**

Event will have this status code when the previous event is failed to send.

For example, consider you have 5 events: **E1<-E2<-E3<-E4<-E5**
You send them all to publish in a batch command.
**E1** and **E2** are sent successfully **(200 OK)**.
**E3** is malformed **(400 Bad Request)**.
If we send **E4** and **E5** we will have a broken chain so that is not a good option.
In this case we should skip sending **E4** and **E5** and have status code **503** for those.

```
[
     {
      "id": "9cdd0f68-df85-44b0-88bd-fc4163ac90a0",
      "status_code": 200,
      "result": "SUCCESS",
      "message": "Event sent successfully"
     },
     {
      "id": "9cdd0f68-df85-44b0-88bd-fc4163ac90a1",
      "status_code": 200,
      "result": "SUCCESS",
      "message": "Event sent successfully"
     },
     {
      "status_code": 400,
      "result": "Bad Request",
      "message": "Invalid event content, client need to fix problem in event before submitting again"
     },
     {
      "status_code": 503,
      "result": "Service Unavailable",
      "message": "Please check previous event and try again later"
     },
     {
      "status_code": 503,
      "result": "Service Unavailable",
      "message": "Please check previous event and try again later"
     }
]
```

**NOTE:** you can open the RabbitMQ's management console and find these messages in a queue.
